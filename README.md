# VSD-FGPA-BOARD-REPO BY ATHRV SHARMA
> I am creating this repository for the fgpa board provided by `VSDIAT`. This repository covers all the steps, tasks and the installation process for the fgpa board.
> This all is based upon the steps mentioned in the datasheet, you can access the datasheet [here.](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/VSDSquadronFMDatasheet.pdf)

Here is all that is covered in this repository:
- [x] Installation and settings
- [x] Understanding the verilog code, pin placements, and the pcf file

# Getting Started :
So, we start off by installing `Oracle VirtualBox` and then creating a new Operating System. You can download it from [Here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
>[!NOTE]
> We must also install the vsd virtual hard disk file for this.
