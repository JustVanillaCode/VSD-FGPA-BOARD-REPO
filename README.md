# VSD-FGPA-BOARD-REPO
> I am creating this repository for the fgpa board provided by `VSDIAT`. This repository covers all the steps, tasks and the installation process for the fgpa board.

# Getting Started :
So, we start off by installing `Oracle VirtualBox` and then creating a new Operating System.
>[!NOTE]
>For this, we also must install the vsd virtual hard disk file.

>This is how it should look like
